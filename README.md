# Search Function and List Views - README

This README provides an overview of the implementation of search functionality and list views in an Android application. The project consists of three main activities: `CourseActivity`, `MainActivity`, and `MainActivity2`, and it allows users to view a list of courses, filter the list based on search queries, and access course details.

## CourseActivity

### Overview

`CourseActivity` is responsible for displaying detailed information about a specific course. It receives data from the intent and presents course details, including the course name, description, duration, location, and optional images and videos.

### Implementation

- **Receiving Data**: Data is received from the previous activity using `intent.getSerializableExtra`. In this case, the activity receives data related to a specific course, including text-based details and optional image and video files.

- **Displaying Data**: The course details are displayed on the activity's layout using `TextView` and `ImageView` (for images) or `VideoView` (for videos). The received data is populated in the corresponding views.

## MainActivity

### Overview

`MainActivity` is the entry point of the application and is responsible for displaying a list of course categories. It utilizes Retrofit to make API calls to retrieve category data.

### Implementation

- **API Integration**: Retrofit is used to make HTTP GET requests to the backend API to fetch a list of course categories.

- **Category Listing**: The retrieved categories are displayed in a RecyclerView using a custom adapter (`CategoryAdapter3`). This adapter is responsible for populating the category data in the RecyclerView.

- **Navigation**: Users can navigate to the second activity (`MainActivity2`) by clicking on the "Search" button.

## MainActivity2

### Overview

`MainActivity2` displays a list of courses and allows users to search for specific courses based on their preferences. It provides a search view for users to enter search queries and filter the list of courses accordingly.

### Implementation

- **API Integration**: Similar to `MainActivity`, this activity utilizes Retrofit to make HTTP GET requests to the backend API to retrieve a list of courses.

- **Course Listing**: The retrieved course data is displayed in a RecyclerView using a custom adapter (`CategoryAdapter2`). This adapter is responsible for populating the course data in the RecyclerView.

- **Search Functionality**: The activity offers search functionality through an Android `SearchView` widget. Users can enter search queries, and the list of courses is filtered based on the provided search text.

## Custom Adapters

The custom adapters (`CategoryAdapter1` and `CategoryAdapter2`) used in `MainActivity` and `MainActivity2` are designed to populate the RecyclerView with course data. They include the implementation of item click events to navigate to the `CourseActivity` when a course is selected.

### Filtering (CategoryAdapter2)

In `CategoryAdapter2`, a filter function is implemented to allow users to search for courses based on the course duration. The `filter` function takes a search query as input and filters the displayed course list accordingly.

## Conclusion

This Android application project demonstrates the implementation of list views and search functionality. Users can explore course categories, view detailed course information, and search for specific courses. The project leverages Retrofit for API integration and custom adapters for RecyclerViews to present data efficiently.

Please note that this README provides a high-level overview of the project components. For detailed code implementations, refer to the source code files in the project.

For further enhancements and additional features, consider implementing features like authentication and user accounts to provide a more comprehensive user experience.
